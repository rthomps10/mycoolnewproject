#Studio 9  
##Versioning  

**Goal:** To solve problem of multiplicity.  

**File System:**  

- where changes are made to text
 

**Stage:**  

- combining changes of file into a package
- this package is then committed to journal as version (Git)  

**Git:**  

- new version control system
- your journal of work  
- timeline of events, sequential  

**git init** - (FS) set up structure above, keep track of folder  
**git add** - (Stage) package  
**git commit** - (Git) store as version in journal  
**git push** - copy journal to remote server (Github)  
**git pull** - copy from server to file system, must sync with server before adding new versions if other users have added new versions as well.  
**git status** - what is happening in this folder?  
**git checkout** - get version from server and override any changes made to that version  

Lab notes must be added to github!!
